[app]
app_description = """
This app allows you to assess the impact on the economics of the proposed banking and cards platform due to changes 
in financial operation assumptions of our network companies. The right sidebar contains settings that will
__dynamically__ update the charts below when changed. Simply expand the section you would like to edit and 
adjust the values. Default values have been selected based on our interviews with Presidents and review of 
available company data. 

The results are quite sensitive to the incoming and outgoing transaction volume and mix. Regarding the "Breakdown
by Type", you will notice a "checksum" value. This dynamically totals the money movement mix. You will want to make
sure this total is 100. __Please note there is no data validation that prevents values from being greater or less than 100.__

If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to Brad on slack.

[onboarding]
intro = """
This section illustrates a (tentative) base case plan for the migration of our companies onto our
financial products platform. Beginning with ~3 companies at the start of Q4, we slowly ramp up
onboarding over the next ~9 months until we have caught up with expected new company growth in the 
middle of 2023. From then on, we migrate companies on pace with our acquisition speed.

At an average company monthly deposits balance of \\$%s total deposits would reach \\$%smm at 100 companies

at the current base assumed transaction type mix, will be dominated by issuance of checks.

run rate evolves over time.

comments = """
Fees earned through interest on deposits would be the primary revenue driver, comprising ~80% of the total revenue earned. 
The amount earned is a function of the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) and total deposits. The formula varies by partner bank. 
Our would-be partner bank through Unit -  Blue Ridge Bank - offers the best terms. 
This is the primary driver behind Unitâ€™s clear outperformance under the base assumptions.

comments = """
A key difference is Unit and Treasury Prime have monthly fixed costs, while Stripe's are all usage based. 
Ultimately, all three vendors have comparable costs under the base assumptions. At scale, the majority of 
the cost of these platforms goes to issuing checks (see expanded sections). 
Encouraging our companies to move toward alternative electronic payment methods will dramatically reduce the costs of the platform.
